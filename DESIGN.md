# Design

Keep things fairly informal.

## Basic Direction

* [ ] Optimise for 1 person teams.
* [ ] Minimise interactions needed to get things done.
* [ ] Automate things where possible.
* [ ] Validate things, across files where possible.
* [ ] Make invalid things impossible to be produced where possible.
* [ ] Focus on core data - don't optimise for a user interaction implementation. Keep future automatic code generation in mind.
* [ ] Use simple searchable formats (e.g. can be grepped) and parsed using off the shelf libraries.
* [ ] Work directly with source repos.
* [ ] Favour more common notations.
* [ ] Don't use helvetica!. Keep things looking informal.
